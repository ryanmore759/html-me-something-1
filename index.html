                <h2>Home Decorators Collection in Hazelwood, MO</h2>
                <p>Home Decorators Collection now a division of Home Depot started out as a mail order catalogue. 
                    When I began my career here, I started out as a customer service representative and eventually
                     went into inventory management for the blinds department. Home Decorators Collection is now a
                      brand of Home Depot.</p>

                <p>My career as an accountant started here at Lemmitt Limousine. Although not officially my title, this job gave me the skills I needed to become proficient in the office and how one is run.</p>

            <h2>Kernz Group FAES in Earth City, MO</h2>
            <p>Kernz Group FAES short for Fine Arts Express Services was another company where my career grew from bookkeeper to 
                Accountant with guidance and mentorship from the CPA we had there. This company transported art across the lower 48 states. 
                During my tenure here, I took a class which was a part of my training requirement for the year called WIBO, or, 
                Workshop In Business Opportunies. This class took me through every part of business which gave me the confidence I needed 
                to start, build, and maintain a business.</p>

            <h2>NumberTrak Accounting LLC in Saint Louis, MO</h2>
            <p>During my tenure at Kernz Group, the class I started mentioned above, WIBO, took my skills to another level by creating a business 
                from scratch. This is where NumberTrak Accounting LLC was born. At NumberTrak, quite a few accomplishments have been made over the 
                last couple years. I became a QuickBooks Certified ProAdvisor, Notary, and obtained a service mark which is similar to a trademark 
                for my logo. I created my logo from scratch and with the help of the 1on1 platform, created a website which can be viewed 
                at www.numbertrak.com. </p>

                <h2>River Roads Distributing Co in Saint Louis, MO</h2>
                <p>In January of 2018, I started as an Accounting Manager at River Roads while NumberTrak continues to grow. At River Roads, 
                    we sell and repair trailers and containers and lease them out as well. We also have a lot where customers may pay for monthly 
                    parking for their equipment.</p>

                  <h2>Student @ LaunchCode</h2>
                  <p>As of July 2018, I started a coding class. The motivation behind this is that I am a very inquisitive person, and my kids, 
                      ages 20 and 14 are needing me less which gave me a lot of free time to explore coding. I am hoping to find a new career path 
                      since it is an ever changing field in which I can consistently expand on always learning something new. </p>
